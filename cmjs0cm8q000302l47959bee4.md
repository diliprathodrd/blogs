If you’re new to Git, chances are you’ve already seen a list of commands like:

```bash
git init
git add
git commit
```

And thought:

> “Okay… but what do these actually do?”

In this blog, we’ll slow things down and build Git knowledge **from the ground up**.  
No rushing. No jargon overload. Just clear concepts and a simple workflow.

## What Is Git?

Git is a **version control system**.

In simple words:

> Git helps you keep track of changes in your code over time.

It allows you to:

* Save versions of your project
    
* Go back to older versions
    
* Work safely with other developers
    
* Understand who changed what and why
    

Git does this **locally on your machine**, even without the internet.

That’s why Git is called a **distributed version control system** — every developer has a full copy of the project and its history.

## Why Git Is Used

Before Git, developers:

* Shared code using zip files
    
* Overwrote each other’s work
    
* Lost track of changes
    
* Had no clear history
    

Git solves all of that.

With Git, you get:

* A complete history of your project
    
* Safe collaboration
    
* Easy bug tracking
    
* Confidence to experiment without fear
    

Once you use Git properly, working without it feels risky.

## Git Basics: Core Terminologies You Must Know

Before touching commands, let’s understand a few important words.  
These concepts matter more than memorizing syntax.

### Repository (Repo)

A **repository** is where Git tracks your project.

It includes:

* Your project files
    
* A hidden `.git` folder that stores history
    

Think of a repository as:

> “A project folder with memory”

### Commit

A **commit** is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

Each commit:

* Saves the current state of your files
    
* Has a message explaining the change
    
* Becomes part of the project history
    

Think of commits like **save points in a game**.

### Branch

A **branch** is a separate line of development.

It allows you to:

* Work on new features
    
* Fix bugs
    
* Experiment safely
    

All without breaking the main code.

You’ll learn more about branches later — for now, just know they exist to keep work isolated.

### HEAD

**HEAD** is simply a pointer to where you currently are in the project history.

In simple terms:

> HEAD = “your current commit”

## Essential Git Commands (Beginner-Friendly)

Now let’s look at the most important Git commands — the ones you’ll use every day.

### `git init` — Start Git Tracking

This command creates a new Git repository.

```bash
git init
```

What it does:

* Creates the `.git` folder
    
* Tells Git: “Start tracking this project”
    

You usually run this **once per project**.

### `git status` — Check What’s Going On

```bash
git status
```

This is your **most-used command**.

It tells you:

* Which files are changed
    
* Which files are staged
    
* What Git is waiting for
    

Whenever you’re confused, run `git status`.

### `git add` — Prepare Changes

```bash
git add file.txt
```

or

```bash
git add .
```

This command:

* Takes changes
    
* Puts them into the **staging area**
    

Staging means:

> “These changes are ready to be committed”

Nothing is saved to history yet.

### `git commit` — Save a Snapshot

```bash
git commit -m "Add login feature"
```

This command:

* Creates a commit
    
* Saves a snapshot of staged changes
    
* Adds a message for clarity
    

Good commit messages explain **why**, not just **what**.

### `git log` — View History

```bash
git log
```

This shows:

* All commits
    
* Commit messages
    
* Authors and timestamps
    

This is how Git lets you travel back in time.

## A Simple Git Workflow (From Scratch)

Let’s put everything together.

### Step 1: Create a Project

```bash
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
```

### Step 2: Create or Edit Files

```bash
index.html
style.css
```

### Step 3: Check Status

```bash
git status
```

### Step 4: Stage Changes

```bash
git add .
```

### Step 5: Commit Changes

```bash
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
```

Repeat this cycle:

> Change → Add → Commit

That’s the core Git workflow.

## What Git Is Really Doing

Behind the scenes:

* Git stores snapshots
    
* Links commits together
    
* Tracks history safely
    
* Never loses data easily
    

Commands are just ways to talk to this system.

Once you understand the workflow, Git starts feeling natural.

## Common Beginner Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

* Forgetting to commit regularly
    
* Writing unclear commit messages
    
* Being scared to experiment
    
* Memorizing commands without understanding
    

Focus on **concepts first**. Commands will follow.

## What’s Coming Next in the Series

In the next part, we’ll cover:

* Git vs GitHub (very important)
    
* Local vs remote repositories
    
* How push and pull actually work
    

## Final Thoughts

Git is not about commands.

It’s about:

* History
    
* Safety
    
* Confidence
    
* Collaboration
    

Once the basics are clear, Git becomes one of the most powerful tools in your developer toolkit.

And this is just the beginning 🚀
