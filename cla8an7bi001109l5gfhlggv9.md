Whenever we hear about any big company names in news or anywhere else, the first thing we do is go to google.com and search about it. We get a lot of information about the company on the website.

Website is very important for any organization, business, or individual to spread the information they want to share about them.

Did you think about how actually these websites work and how these websites actually developed behind the scene? I will talk more about it in this article.

Let's walk through and see what is website, how it works, and some more technical aspects of it. Website is a client-server architecture. so let's understand client-server architecture with the help of the below diagram.

Let's take the example of Rohit. Rohit is a first-year student who recently completed his schooling and joined a college. Rohit heard about Facebook from his friend and now he wants to know more about it.

He opened a google browser on his laptop and searched www.facebook.com and he get some information about Facebook on his laptop.

Here Rohit is the client, by entering www.facebook.com he sent a request to the Facebook server. Facebook server processed his request and sent a response back to Rohit which he can see on his laptop.

So the website is what we see on the screen of a laptop, mobile, etc. basically a response sent by the server. Websites contain web pages. These web pages are stored on web servers and served us (the client) based on our request. If we click on the sign-up button, we will see a registration form that we need to fill and if we click on the login button, we will see a page where we will get an option to enter a username and password and a login button.

Response from the web server is based on the type of request we made. This is just an overview of the website. In the next article we will see, what is a web page, how it is developed, and the scope of web development. Hit the follow button to read such articles about web development.
