Before coming to the conclusion of why should we use emmet while writing code, lets first understand what is emmet?

# What is emmet? 🤔

# How emmet helps to speed up the development?

Let's take a simple example of below boilerplate code in html.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>
```

If you write this code by your own, it will take some time. But if you know about emmet, you can simply type `Ctrl + !` and press the tab key, you will get the above code.
